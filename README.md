## React Patterns - Compound Components

## React Patterns - State Reducer

Main idea is creating logic and state handlers witout any particular UI attached.

For example creating counter logic (increment, decrement and value) but without buttons. Then allow user to pass how state should be updated. (inversion of control). So user can set that after 4 clicks counter no longer increases.
